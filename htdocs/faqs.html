                      <p>The founders of FreePlus Accounts are two businessmen, Doug Conran and Sean Proctor. Doug developed an accounting package to support his own business, Corunna Systems when he found the widely available accounting packages over-complex for his requirements and difficult to use.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>Doug later teamed up with Sean to turn FreePlus Accounts into an online service that could be used by anyone for free. The idea behind FreePlus Accounts is to help smaller businesses and start-ups by providing a service that meets their needs without a huge price tag. The founders are not looking for a huge personal financial return from the service. As businessmen themselves, Doug and Sean recognised the value of such a service and generously wanted to make it available to others. </p>

                      There isn’t one. All of the core features of the service are absolutely free to users and provide a fully functional accounting system for any small business. There is no time or use limit, once you’ve signed up you can use the service as often as you want and for as long as you want with no charge.</p>

                      <p>There is a  small fee for advertising your business on FreePlus Accounts. Adverts are  targeted to your local area and to businesses that may need your products or  services so it can be a very effective way of advertising. </p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p> To advertise  your business, you will need to purchase advertising credits. Look for the  information on how to do this when you log out of FreePlus Accounts, or contact us by email with your request. </p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p> Advertising is  generally charged for, but from time to time you may be given advertising  credits that offer you some advertising for free.</p>
