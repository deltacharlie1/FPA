Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could.","author":"Rudyard Kipling","poem":"Jungle Book","link":"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/236/236-h/236-h.htm","authors":[{"name":"Wilhelm Grimm"},{"name":"John Stuart Mill"},{"name":"Constance Garnett"},{"name":"Alexander Pope"},{"name":"Rudyard Kipling"},{"name":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky"}],"l1":"o","l2":"r","shuffled":"iyp jezrgvfaluncswqoxdbkhmt"},

The object of treating each topic in a paragraph by itself is, of course, to aid the reader.

I believe one-half of the children whose deaths are occasioned by accident suffer from this cause alone: indeed, almost every week the newspapers contain some melancholy confirmation of what I have here stated.
