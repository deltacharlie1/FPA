<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">Seven Reasons to use FreePlus
Accounts:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">It&rsquo;s free&hellip;. Yes
	really. Not a free trial, but free to use. A very modest monthly
	subscription gives more facilities but the free service works for
	basic accounts.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">It&rsquo;s an on-line, web
	based system (cloud computing is here) that runs on the FreePlus
	server so it&rsquo;s accessible from any location with an internet
	connected PC. So, no software to load and maintain on your PC as you
	always have the latest version and all you need is a browser.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">It&rsquo;s safe and secure.
	There&rsquo;s no data or software held on your PC, it&rsquo;s all on
	the FreePlus server so there are no backups, off-site data storage
	or program updates to worry about. A two stage log on process helps
	to keep your access and data secure.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">It&rsquo;s intuitive. As a
	non-accountant I like the simplicity and lack of accounting jargon
	with functions such as &lsquo;Pay money out&rsquo; which I can
	understand. It&rsquo;s obviously a help to know what a nominal
	ledger is but the accounting terminology is used sparingly and only
	where necessary.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">It&rsquo;s flexible. Invoices
	can be designed to be the shape you want and contain the detail you
	want (with a subscription) or you can use the default layout, with
	or without a logo. Invoices, credit notes and quotations can be
	printed and posted or e-mailed from within the system. There are
	standard reports to view or print and some analysis reports with
	selection criteria to list items according to date, type, reference,
	etc.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">It&rsquo;s approved by The
	Institute of Certified Bookkeepers so I can be confident the
	accounting process is sound and VAT returns will be correct, which
	gives me peace of mind.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">It&rsquo;s fully supported.
	Questions are answered, there&rsquo;s FAQs, a forum to post queries,
	a user manual to download and the support staff are friendly,
	competent and know the system, and it&rsquo;s all provided at no
	extra cost.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11cm">So, if you want an easy to use,
functional accounts package for a sole trader or small business, it&rsquo;s
waiting for you at <b>www.freeplusaccounts.co.uk/<b>
