<h1>Why Help Support this Site?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>FreePlus Accounts is a very easy-to-use, fully functional accounting application for startups, small businesses and sole traders.</li>
  <li>It is completely free to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;We strongly believe that, in the current financial climate, small businesses need all the help they can get and having access to a good accounting system is important in helping them to operate efficiently.</li>
  <li>However - although it is free to use, it is NOT free to run!&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the development is all paid for, we still incur hosting and support costs.</li>
  <li>We therefore need to get money somehow and the way we have chosen to do this is by generating advertising revenue.</li>
<li><b>This is where you come in.</b></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h1>How you can Help</h1>
<ul>
  <li>You can help us (whether or not you use our free accounting package) by buying things on the internet through us.</li>
  <li>First of all <a href="http://www.corunna.com" title="Corunna Home Page" class="jQueryBookmark">Click Here</a> to bookmark our adverts page.</li>
  <li>Then, whenever you want to buy anything on the internet:-
    <ol>
      <li>just select the adverts page from your 'Favourites'</li>
      <li>select the advertiser that can best meet your needs (Amazon is always a good choice)</li>
      <li>make your purchase.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>It doesn't cost you any extra but, for every purchase, we get a small commission.</li>
  <li>In fact not only does it not cost you any extra but you are also assured of using genuine, reliable and good-value suppliers because we do not want our reputation tarnished by fly-by-night traders.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
So, please, help us to continue providing a great and free service to small businesses (after all, you may be in that position yourself sometime!) and help yourself at the same time by buying through us.
<br/><br/>
All of us at FreePlus Accounts thank you for supporting us in this way.
<br/>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>
